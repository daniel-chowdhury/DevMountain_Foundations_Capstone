Shoot the ball toward the goal!!

Welcome to my amateur soccer shooting game. Simply choose the angle of the ball, the speed of the ball, and then shoot the ball toward the goal on the farthest right, avoiding the goalkeeper. If you score, the goalkeeper will move faster (maximum speed is reached if the score is 50), the goal will move to a random location vertically (top, middle, and bottom) along the right edge of the screen, and score will increment by 1. If the ball bounces off the border and hits the goal, score will increment by 4


Max angle: 75 degrees


Min angle: -75 degrees



Max speed: 3 of 3


Min speed: 1 of 3
